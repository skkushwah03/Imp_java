🔥 TOP 100 JAVA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS
🧱 JAVA BASICS (1–15)
1. What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.

2. Why Java is platform independent?

Because Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on JVM, not directly on OS.

3. What is JVM?

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) executes Java bytecode and makes Java platform independent.

4. Difference between JDK, JRE, JVM?

JDK: Development tools + JRE

JRE: JVM + libraries

JVM: Runs bytecode

5. What is bytecode?

Intermediate code generated by Java compiler (.class file).

6. What is class?

Blueprint of an object.

7. What is object?

Instance of a class.

8. Why main() method is static?

So JVM can call it without creating an object.

9. Why main() is public?

So JVM can access it from anywhere.

10. What is access modifier?

Controls visibility of variables/methods/classes.

11. Types of access modifiers?

public

protected

default

private

12. What is variable?

Container to store data.

13. Types of variables?

Local

Instance

Static

14. What is data type?

Defines type and size of data.

15. Types of data types?

Primitive

Non-primitive

🧠 OOPS CONCEPTS (16–35)
16. What is OOP?

Programming using objects and classes.

17. What is encapsulation?

Binding data and methods together (data hiding).

18. What is inheritance?

Acquiring properties of parent class.

19. Types of inheritance in Java?

Single

Multilevel
(Hybrid & multiple via interface)

20. What is polymorphism?

One method, many forms.

21. Types of polymorphism?

Compile time (Overloading)

Runtime (Overriding)

22. What is method overloading?

Same method name, different parameters.

23. What is method overriding?

Redefining parent class method in child class.

24. Can we override static methods?

❌ No (method hiding happens)

25. What is abstraction?

Hiding implementation details.

26. Abstract class vs Interface?
Abstract	Interface
Can have methods	Mostly abstract
Can have constructor	No constructor
27. Can abstract class have constructor?

✅ Yes

28. Can interface have method body?

✅ Yes (Java 8 default methods)

29. Can we create object of abstract class?

❌ No

30. What is this keyword?

Refers to current object.

31. What is super keyword?

Refers to parent class object.

32. What is final keyword?

final variable → constant

final method → cannot override

final class → cannot inherit

33. What is constructor?

Used to initialize object.

34. Types of constructor?

Default

Parameterized

35. Constructor vs Method?

Constructor initializes object, method performs operation.

🧵 STRING & MEMORY (36–55)
36. What is String?

Immutable sequence of characters.

37. Why String is immutable?

For security, memory optimization, thread safety.

38. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer?
String	StringBuilder	StringBuffer
Immutable	Mutable	Mutable
Slow	Fast	Thread-safe
39. What is String pool?

Memory area for storing String literals.

40. How to reverse a string?

Using loop or StringBuilder.

41. What is wrapper class?

Converts primitive into object.

42. Examples of wrapper classes?

int → Integer
char → Character

43. What is autoboxing?

Primitive → Wrapper automatically.

44. What is unboxing?

Wrapper → Primitive automatically.

45. What is memory leak?

Unused objects not garbage collected.

46. Stack vs Heap?

Stack → local variables

Heap → objects

47. What is garbage collection?

Automatic memory management.

48. Can we force GC?

❌ No (only suggest using System.gc())

49. What is == vs .equals()?

== compares reference

.equals() compares content

50. What is immutable object?

Object whose state cannot change.

📦 COLLECTIONS (56–75)
56. What is Collection Framework?

Group of classes & interfaces to store data.

57. Difference between Array and ArrayList?

Array fixed size, ArrayList dynamic.

58. ArrayList vs LinkedList?

ArrayList faster search, LinkedList faster insertion.

59. What is HashMap?

Key-value based data structure.

60. HashMap vs Hashtable?

Hashtable is synchronized, HashMap is not.

61. HashMap vs TreeMap?

TreeMap sorted order, HashMap unordered.

62. Can HashMap have null key?

✅ Yes (one null key)

63. What is Set?

No duplicate elements.

64. HashSet vs TreeSet?

TreeSet sorted, HashSet unordered.

65. What is Iterator?

Used to traverse collection.

66. Fail-fast vs Fail-safe?

Fail-fast throws exception, fail-safe doesn’t.

67. What is Comparable?

Used for natural sorting.

68. What is Comparator?

Custom sorting logic.

69. What is Map?

Stores key-value pairs.

70. Can Map have duplicate keys?

❌ No

71. What is Queue?

FIFO data structure.

72. PriorityQueue?

Queue based on priority.

73. Vector vs ArrayList?

Vector synchronized, ArrayList not.

74. What is Collections class?

Utility class for collection methods.

75. What is concurrent modification exception?

When collection modified during iteration.

⚠️ EXCEPTION & MULTITHREADING (76–100)
76. What is exception?

Runtime error.

77. Checked vs unchecked exception?

Checked → compile time
Unchecked → runtime

78. Example of unchecked exception?

NullPointerException

79. try-catch-finally?

Used to handle exceptions.

80. Can finally be skipped?

Yes (System.exit())

81. throw vs throws?

throw → manually throw
throws → declare exception

82. What is custom exception?

User-defined exception.
