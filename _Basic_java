🔹 OOP CONCEPTS (1–20)
1. What is OOP?

Answer:
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming style based on objects and classes that helps in code reusability, security, and modularity.

2. What are the four pillars of OOP?

Answer:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

3. What is Encapsulation?

Answer:
Wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class) and hiding data using private access modifier.

4. How do you achieve Encapsulation in Java?

Answer:

Declare variables as private

Provide public getter and setter methods

5. What is Inheritance?

Answer:
One class acquires properties of another class using extends keyword.

6. Why inheritance is used?

Answer:
For code reuse, method overriding, and hierarchical relationship.

7. Types of inheritance supported in Java?

Answer:

Single

Multilevel

Hierarchical
(Java does NOT support multiple inheritance with classes)

8. Why Java does not support multiple inheritance?

Answer:
Because of Diamond Problem ambiguity.

9. What is Polymorphism?

Answer:
One method behaving differently in different situations.

10. Types of Polymorphism?

Answer:

Compile-time (Method Overloading)

Runtime (Method Overriding)

11. What is method overloading?

Answer:
Same method name but different parameters in same class.

12. Can we overload main method?

Answer:
✅ Yes, but JVM calls only public static void main(String[] args).

13. What is method overriding?

Answer:
Child class provides its own implementation of parent class method.

14. Rules for method overriding?

Answer:

Same method name

Same parameters

IS-A relationship

Cannot reduce access level

15. What is Abstraction?

Answer:
Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality.

16. How to achieve abstraction in Java?

Answer:

Abstract class

Interface

17. Difference between abstract class and interface?

Answer:

Answer:
A block of code performing a task.

40. Why methods are used?

Answer:
Code reusability & readability.

🔹 STRING HANDLING (41–60)
41. What is String in Java?

Answer:
String is a non-primitive immutable class.

42. Why String is immutable?

Answer:
For security, thread safety, and caching.

43. Difference between String and StringBuilder?

Answer:
String is immutable, StringBuilder is mutable.

44. Difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffer?

Answer:
StringBuffer is thread-safe, StringBuilder is not.

45. Which is faster?

Answer:
StringBuilder

46. What is String pool?

Answer:
Memory area inside heap to store String literals.

47. How many objects created?
String s = "Java";
String s2 = "Java";


Answer:
1 object

48. How many objects created?
String s = new String("Java");


Answer:
2 objects

49. Can we compare String using ==?

Answer:
Yes, but it compares reference not content.

50. Correct way to compare String?

Answer:
equals()

51. What does equals() do?

56. What is substring()?

Answer:
Extracts part of string.

57. Is String thread-safe?

Answer:
