1. What is Spring Boot?
✅ Simple Meaning:

Spring Boot is a framework used to build Java web applications and REST APIs quickly without much configuration.

✅ Key Points:

Part of Spring Framework

Removes XML configuration

Provides auto-configuration     

Has embedded server (Tomcat)

👉 Example: You can run app using just main() method.

2. What is REST API?
✅ Simple Meaning:

REST API is a way for applications to communicate over the internet using HTTP.

REST = Representational State Transfer

✅ Example:

When you open:

https://api.weather.com


It returns data → that's REST API.

3. Difference between @Controller and @RestController
Feature	@Controller	@RestController
Returns	HTML Pages	JSON Data
Used in	MVC apps	REST APIs
Need @ResponseBody	Yes	No
👉 Easy Trick:
@RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody

4. What is @Autowired?
✅ Meaning:

It is used to automatically inject objects (dependencies) into a class.

👉 Example:
@Autowired
UserService service;


Spring automatically creates object.

5. What are HTTP Methods?

These are operations in REST API.

Method	Use
GET	Fetch data
POST	Create data
PUT	Update data
DELETE	Remove data
6. What is JSON?
✅ Meaning:

JSON = JavaScript Object Notation

It is a data format used to send/receive data in APIs.

👉 Example:
{
  "name": "Saurav",
  "age": 22
}

7. What is Dependency Injection?
✅ Meaning:

A design pattern where object dependencies are provided by Spring, not created manually.

👉 Without DI:
UserService service = new UserService();

👉 With DI:

Spring automatically injects object using @Autowired.

8. What is ResponseEntity?
✅ Meaning:

It is used to control HTTP response completely.

You can set:

Status code

Headers

Body

👉 Example:
return ResponseEntity.ok("Success");

9. Difference between PUT and POST
Feature	POST	PUT
Use	Create new data	Update existing data
Idempotent	No	Yes
Example	Add user	Update user
10. What is application.properties file used for?
✅ Meaning:

It is used to store configuration settings of Spring Boot app.

👉 Example:
server.port=8081
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/db
