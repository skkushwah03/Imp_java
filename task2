✅ 1. What is Spring Boot?

👉 Definition:

Spring Boot is a Java framework used to build standalone, production-ready applications quickly with minimal configuration.

🧠 Simple Words:

Spring Boot helps you create web applications fast without writing complex setup code.

⭐ Key Features:

• Auto Configuration
• Embedded Server (Tomcat)
• No XML configuration
• Easy REST API development

🎯 Interview One-Line Answer:

Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies Spring application development using auto-configuration and embedded servers.

✅ 2. What is REST API?

👉 Definition:

REST API is a way for different applications to communicate over HTTP using standard methods.

🧠 Simple Meaning:

It is a web service that allows client & server to exchange data.

📌 Example:

When mobile app requests data from server → REST API is used.

⭐ HTTP Methods Used:

GET → Fetch data
POST → Create data
PUT → Update data
DELETE → Remove data

✅ 3. Difference Between POST and PUT
Feature	POST	PUT
Purpose	Create new resource	Update existing resource
Idempotent	❌ No	✅ Yes
Used When	Adding new data	Updating data
🧠 Easy Example:

POST → Add new student
PUT → Update student marks

✅ 4. What is ResponseEntity?

👉 Definition:

ResponseEntity is a class in Spring used to send HTTP response with status, headers, and body.

🧠 Why Used?

It gives full control over API response.

📌 Example:
return ResponseEntity.ok("Success");


This sends:

Body → "Success"
Status → 200 OK

✅ 5. What is @RestController?

👉 Definition:

@RestController is an annotation that combines:

@Controller + @ResponseBody

🧠 Meaning:

It tells Spring that this class will handle REST API requests.

📌 Example:
@RestController
public class StudentController {
}

✅ 6. What is Validation?

👉 Definition:

Validation means checking if input data is correct, valid, and safe before processing.

🧠 Example:

Checking:

• Email format
• Marks between 0–100
• Name not empty

⭐ In Spring Boot:

We use annotations like:

@NotNull
@NotBlank
@Email
@Size

✅ 7. What is HTTP Status Code?

👉 Definition:

HTTP status codes are numbers sent by server to indicate result of request.

⭐ Common Codes:
Code	Meaning
200	Success
201	Created
400	Bad Request
404	Not Found
500	Server Error
✅ 8. What is JSON?

👉 Definition:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used to exchange data.

📌 Example:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Saurav",
  "marks": 85
}


Spring Boot automatically converts Java objects ↔ JSON.

✅ 9. What is MVC Architecture?

👉 Definition:

MVC is a design pattern that separates application into 3 parts.

🧠 Components:
Layer	Role
Model	Data & business logic
View	UI
Controller	Handles request
🎯 Flow:

User → Controller → Service → Database → Response

✅ 10. How Spring Boot Works?

👉 Working Flow:

1️⃣ Main class starts application
2️⃣ Auto-configuration loads dependencies
3️⃣ Embedded server starts (Tomcat)
4️⃣ Controller handles requests
5️⃣ Response returned as JSON

🧠 Easy Flow Diagram:
Client Request → Controller → Service → Repository → Database

                                      JSON Response
